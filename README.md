# 🌍 My Terraform Practice

## Overview

This repository contains my personal Terraform practice projects and notes. It's a collection of various configurations and scripts I've worked on to deepen my understanding of Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

- **Terraform Basics**: My exercises and notes on the core concepts and workflow of Terraform.
- **Providers and Resources**: Practice configurations using different Terraform providers and resources.
- **State Management**: Experiments with managing Terraform state, including remote state storage.
- **Modules**: Custom modules I've created to explore reusability and organization of Terraform code.
- **Best Practices**: Notes on best practices for structuring Terraform projects, managing secrets, and ensuring security.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `basics/`: Basic Terraform configurations and initial experiments.
- `providers/`: Practice with different cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To revisit or extend any of my practice configurations:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-practice.git
    cd terraform-practice
    ```

2. **Initialize Terraform** in the desired directory:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Apply configurations** to test and see results:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
